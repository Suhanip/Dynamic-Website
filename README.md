# Dynamic-Website
Fully Dynamic Website using the resources of AWS Cloud

It is the Fully Dynamic Website.
The Website is created using XAMPP(Apache:for frontend and MySQL:for database).
**always store your website code in htdocs folder in XAMPP.

I have hosted it by using Elastic BeanStalk service in AWS console.
1.Open AWS Console,Sign In as root.
2.in services,select Elastic BeanStalk.
3.Click on Create Application.
4.Add application name,upload the zipcode of your folder(where you have stored the PHP codes) and add Application Tags
5.Then click on create.It will automatically create the environment.

You will find the link for your website in the on the top.(ending with beanstalk.com).
